# Sentence Classification with Pre-Trained Embeddings

## Introduction

This project involves using pre-trained embeddings for sentence classification (predicting whether a tweet depicts are real disaster or not). Embeddings are fixed-size dense vector representations of tokens in natural language. They are useful for various NLP tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and sentence classification. This project explores the concept of embeddings and applies them to classify sentences.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and several Python libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install gpt4all numpy pandas nltk gensim torch
```

## Exploring Embeddings

Embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens. This project utilizes pre-trained embeddings from various sources:
- `gensim.downloader` for downloading pre-trained Word2Vec models.
- `gpt4all.Embed4All` for using embeddings from GPT-4 models.

## Model Implementation

The model implementation includes the following key components:
1. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data using `nltk`.
2. **Embedding Layer**: Utilizing pre-trained embeddings to represent sentences as vectors.
3. **Neural Network**: Implementing a neural network using `torch` to classify sentences.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:
1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
2. **Initialize the Model**: Define the neural network architecture and initialize it.
3. **Train the Model**: Set up the training loop, loss function, and optimizer. Train the model on your dataset.
